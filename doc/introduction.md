# Introduction

Creating forms is often a staple in frontend development. Writing them
yourself from scratch takes time. Using a css/html framework makes it easier to
get the desired styling. However, you are still required to write the html and
logic for binding to the forms. What if I could describe my forms in a way that
is readable and easy to edit.

Aurelia is a great tool for generating forms. It enables one to write
components that can be reused. This makes assembling forms nicer. What Aurelia
form does is take this a step further. It does so by still leveraging Aurelia's
components, plus creating a standardized way of describing forms using
JavaScript's objects and arrays. Some of the benefits of aurelia form offers
are.

* concise way of describing forms
* ability to generate forms programmatically
* two way data-binding updates your model
* convenient `Form` class which avoids boilerplate
* out of the box components which can be overwritten

Think of aurelia-form as a way to generate html programmatically and with very
little code.
